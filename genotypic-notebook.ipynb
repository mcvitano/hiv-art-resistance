    "    + The RT mutations L74I/V (L74I or L74V) and M184I/V (M184I or M184V) have penalty scores of 30 and 15, respectively for abacavir (ABC). In addition, L74I/V + M184/V has a penalty score of 15 for ABC. Therefore, a sequence with L74V + M184V will have a total penalty score of 60 (30 + 15 + 15) which is translated into high-level ABC resistance.\n",
    "    + The PR mutations M46I/L, I54V, and V82A have penalty scores of 10, 15, and 30 respectively for lopinavir/r (LPV/r). M54A/L/M/S/T/V + V82A/C/F/M/L/S/T/V has a penalty score of 10 for LPV/r. Therefore, a sequence with M46IL + I54V + V82A will have a total penalty score of 65 (10 + 15 + 30 + 10) which is translated into high-level LPV/r resistance.  \n",
